Introduction
------------

Every language you have ever worked with has a set of methods and
practices that grow up with the language. Its starts out with the
implementer(s) adopting a few things that seem reasonable for their
new language and continues as users adopt those styles and add their
own. Over time these tricks and styles evolve to become the idiom of
the language. In this regard, Erlang is really no different then any
other language you have used. It has an extensive set of commonly used
styles and techniques. You will see these methods over and over
again. Erlang does diverge slightly in that the main focus of its
idioms tends to be towards maintainable, reliable and scalable code as
apposed to terseness or efficiency. This is born out of the culture
where Erlang was created. For a taste of this culture talk with most any of
the long time users on the Erlang mailing list. The benefit of this
approach is that you will get paged less. We suspect that you will
come to appreciate it over time as well.

With that in mind you can now go through few of the more common idiomatic
practices and see how the benefit you.
